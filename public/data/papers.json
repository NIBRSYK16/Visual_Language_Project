    "abstract": "MapReduce clusters are increasingly being used to process large datasets. However, many MapReduce jobs exhibit skewed content popularity, where a small fraction of keys account for a large fraction of the data. This skew can cause significant performance degradation, as a few reducers become overloaded while others remain idle. We present Scarlett, a system that addresses this problem by dynamically adapting to skewed content popularity. Scarlett uses a combination of techniques including dynamic key redistribution, speculative execution, and adaptive partitioning to balance the load across reducers. Our evaluation shows that Scarlett can improve job completion time by up to 3x for jobs with highly skewed data.",

We present DepSky, a system that provides dependable and secure storage by using multiple cloud storage providers (a cloud-of-clouds). DepSky replicates data across multiple clouds and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability even when some clouds fail or are compromised. Our evaluation shows that DepSky can tolerate Byzantine failures and provides better availability and security than using a single cloud provider.",

However, traditional VM migration techniques are too coarse-grained and slow for micro-elasticity. We present Kaleidoscope, a system that enables micro-elasticity through VM state coloring, which allows VMs to be quickly cloned and scaled by sharing and managing VM state efficiently. Kaleidoscope uses a novel state coloring mechanism that tracks and manages VM state at a fine granularity, enabling rapid VM creation and migration. Our evaluation shows that Kaleidoscope can reduce VM startup time by up to 10x compared to traditional approaches.",

We evaluate our system on several real-world applications and show that it can find bugs and achieve high code coverage significantly faster than sequential symbolic execution.",

We present an approach that uses on-demand replica consistency to improve performance while maintaining fault tolerance. Our system allows replicas to operate with relaxed consistency during normal operation and enforces strong consistency only when needed. We evaluate our approach and show that it can improve throughput by up to 3x compared to traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant systems.",

    "abstract": "Co-scheduling is a technique used in virtualized environments to improve performance by scheduling related virtual CPUs together. However, co-scheduling can be expensive, especially for SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) VMs. We investigate the cost of co-scheduling for SMP VMs and propose optimizations to reduce this cost. Our evaluation shows that while co-scheduling can improve performance, the overhead can be significant, and we provide guidelines for when co-scheduling is beneficial.",

We present CheapBFT, a resource-efficient BFT system that reduces the resource requirements of BFT protocols. CheapBFT uses novel techniques to minimize replication overhead and communication costs while maintaining strong fault tolerance guarantees. We evaluate CheapBFT and show that it can achieve BFT with significantly lower resource requirements than existing systems.",
